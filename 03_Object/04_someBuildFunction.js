console.log("hello".length); // give the length of the string 
console.log("anurag mishra".toUpperCase()); // all char of string CAPITALIZE
// These are string not object . How can string have properties and methods?
        // ans is JAVASCRIPT HAS A PROPERTIES OF AUTO-BOXING (wrap the string into a object first and this object has properties of length and toUpperCase())
