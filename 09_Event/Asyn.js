//  javascript is by default
            // synchronous
            // single threaded 
    //   Execution context 
        // executed one line of code at a time 
        // --> each operation wait for the last to complete before executing 

//  Blocking code       VS         Non Blocking code
// --> block the flow of program   --> doesnt block execution 
// --> Read file sync              --> read file async
